For the first submission of the game, only two levels need to be part of the game, these are as follows:
### Demo Level 1
Encounter with A Goblin and an Armoured Goblin. This should allow the demonstration of multi-enemy encounters, and the varied effectiveness of mundane attacks
### Demo Level 2
Encounter with a (significantly weaker) Dragon. Should allow the demonstration of Boss encounters and the use of non-mundane damage types.
### Actual Game
The actual game will be split into three distinct phases - 

Phase 1, where players will be given simple encounters to teach them the basic rules of the game. Ends with a boss at Level 3.

Phase 2, where players must deal with a steady climb in challenge. Ends with a boss at level 7. 

Phase 3, where players will have their skills put to the test in highly difficult encounters. Ends with a boss at level 9 and a final boss at level 10.
