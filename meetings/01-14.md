## Topics Discussed

### Gameplay
- 2D turn-based RPG.
- Simple to understand.
- Three difficulty levels, with different default parameters for each.
- Defeating enemies grants coins; defeating bosses grants more coins.
- 10 levels total:
  - Boss levels at 3, 6, 9, and 10.
  - Difficulty increases over time.
- Every level is an encounter.
- After each encounter, the player enters a shop menu where coins can be spent on upgrades.
- The player has a number of lives, which varies depending on the selected difficulty.
  - If the player dies and has lives remaining, they restart the current level.
  - If the player dies with no lives remaining, they restart the game entirely.
- Each encounter starts with the player at maximum health.

### Three Mechanics to Influence Success
- **Coins** - used to purchase upgrades after completing an encounter.
- **Magic** - used to execute actions during an encounter.
- **Health** - used to evaluate whether a player is alive during an encounter.

### Simulation
- An automated agent is required to play the game in testing.
- This will demonstrate the effects of tweaking gameplay parameters.

### Approach
- Two sprints:
  - **First sprint**: from now until the CW1 deadline.
  - **Second sprint**: from the CW1 deadline until the CW2 deadline.
- Using the **MoSCoW** prioritisation structure:
  - First sprint focuses on **Must-have** goals for the prototype.
  - Second sprint focuses on **Should-have** and **Could-have** goals.

### Changes
- Jira has been scrapped.
- GitHub Issues will be used instead.
