NOTE: This is a very rough draft. This is just a collection of everything which came to mind. Feel free to edit as you see fit.
# Ethical/Legal Considerations

## Privacy of Telemetry

-   The program will not store any user data that is not relevant to gameplay, or the balancing of gameplay
    
-   Any data relevant to the player will be anonymised. For example, player sessions will be identified by a generated numerical identifier,
    

## Consent and Disclosure

-   When the player begins the game, they are informed that their gameplay will be tracked and exclusively used to inform game-balancing, and that this can be disabled if the player wishes to. This message gives a brief overview of what the game records, and how it will be used. It will also state how it will be stored (anonymously etc. )
    

## Accessibility

-   Core Screens can be navigated by keyboard
    
-   All text in game appears in front of a plain black background - this contrast allows readability.
    
-   Both the game and the telemetry elements have mobile-friendly layouts
    
-   A key element of the game’s accessibility is derived from the simplicity within the game. Players have simple options that are described with one word (“Attack”, “Buy”, etc. ).
    
-   Likewise, the User Interface elements (such as the one-word resources the player has to manage) are distinguished from one another by colour, such that a player with a limited understanding of written English can still engage with the game and its mechanics. For example, the player’s “Health” will start by being displayed as a green 100, but as the character takes damage it will appear as red - indicating danger
    
-   Blind players using screen-readers can still enjoy the game, as the UI partially functions as a narrator, i.e, “The Plant Monster attacks the player for 23 Health!”
    
-   Furthermore, the player can select from three difficulty modes (easy/balanced/hard), therefore the game is accessible to all skill levels.
    
-   Ultimately, the purpose of the telemetry side of the project is to help balance the game, meaning it’s unlikely the player will go up against a level of difficulty they find too challenging to still have fun.
    
-   The telemetry interface provides many means of visualising data (pie charts, graphs etc. ), these visual means will be readable, and have high contrast so that they can be interpreted easily.
    
-   The telemetry interface accounts for blind users, using screen readers, as text descriptions of the data will accompany any data visualisations. (i.e a pie chart being accompanied by a table containing section names and percentages occupied)
    
-   The telemetry interface can be navigated with just a keyboard, accounting for those unable to use a mouse.
    

  

## Intellectual Property (IP) and Licensing Implications

-   All assets used within the game and telemetry interface are either royalty free or created by the development team.
    
-   While the characters, aesthetics and mechanics of the game draw some inspiration from countless sources (Dungeons & Dragons, Final Fantasy, etc.), the game created in this project is derivative from its inspiration, as of its focus on simplistic gameplay.
