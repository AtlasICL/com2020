        - Checks to ensure the telemetry contains correct information, and arrives in an order that makes sense. 
    - all telemetry must contain the following
        - Username: str
        - SessionID: int
        - Timestamp: (ss:mm:hh dd/mm/yyyy)
    - should check telemetry is valid before sending it, and attempt to only send valid telemetry.

        - coins
        - health points
        - lives
        - magic

    - Has the following game loop
        1. Sign in as a username
        2. Start a game/run 
        3. Enter an encounter. If they lose the encounter they lose a life. If they lose all their lives they go back to step 2. If they win they go sto step 4
        4. Obtain coins from the encounter
        5. Enter the shop and optionally buy items (upgrades)
        6. Go back to step 3 with another encounter. Every few levels fight a boss.
        7. Once all levels are complete, show player statistics read from the telemetry store.
