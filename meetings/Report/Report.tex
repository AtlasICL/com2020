\section{Project Backlog}
The project was split into three main sections representing the three main areas of work: the documentation, the java application, and the python application. Each of those areas is then further divided into epics and user stories. The epics and stories in this section include both those relevant to sprint 1 and what is planned for sprint 2. Due to the nature of scrum, the epics for sprint 2 may have adapted by the end of that sprint, and so may differ from the epics and stories in this prototype report. 
\subsection{Documentation}
\subsubsection{Prototype Report}
\paragraph{Executive Summary}
As a product owner I need an executive summary to give me an insight into what is to come in the report and provide the most important details to me.
\paragraph{Problem Framing}
As a product owner I need an in depth exploration of the problem so that I am informed of what problem the system should solve and ensure the development team fully understand the problem.
\paragraph{Project Backlog}
As a scrum master I need a project backlog so I can determine what work is to be done in each sprint.
\paragraph{Sprint One Prioritised Requirements}
As a product owner I need to know what requirements are being prioritised in sprint one to know that they align with my priorities.
\paragraph{Architecture Schema}
As a developer I need to know what the project schema is so I can produce code that integrates with it correctly.
\paragraph{Data Flow Schema}
As a developer I need to know what the flow of data is so I can work with the data in a manner that integrates well with the rest of the system.
\paragraph{Telemetry Schema}
As a developer I need to know the telemetry schema so I can interact with telemetry events correctly in a way which integrates well with the rest of the system.
\paragraph{Initial Evaluation}
As a product owner I need an initial evaluation of the prototype so I can see the developers are aware of their product and know what areas to work on in the future to improve it. 
\paragraph{Sprint Two Prioritised Requirements}
As a product owner I need to see what requirements are being prioritised and planned for in sprint two so I can know they align with my priorities. 
\paragraph{Management}
As a product owner I need to see how the team has worked together and what roles each person took on during development so I can evaluate each members performance and ensure the team is working well.
\subsubsection{Meeting Minutes}
\paragraph{Meeting Attendance}
As a scrum master I need to know who is attending meetings so I can follow up people not there to ensure they are kept up to date.
\paragraph{Work Completed}
As a scrum master I need to know what work has been completed in each weekly scrum so I can determine what work needs to be prioritised for the next scrum, and plan for the next sprint. 
\paragraph{Topics Discussed}
As a scrum master I need to know what topics were discussed in the weekly scrum so I can keep developers who could not make it to the meeting updated.
\subsubsection{Risk Register}
\paragraph{List of Risks}
As a stakeholder I need to know what risks there are in the software so I can make informed decisions about the adoption and use of the software. 
\paragraph{Risk Mitigations}
As a stakeholder I need each risk to have a mitigation plan and owner so that risks are actively managed and their impact reduced.
\subsubsection{Ethical and Legal Considerations}
\paragraph{Privacy and Data Protection Analysis}
As a product owner I need the software to handle data in full legal compliance and respect the privacy of users to foster user trust, maintain regulatory compliance and minimise privacy risk. 
\paragraph{Consent and Disclosure Analysis}
As a system user I need the software to obtain my consent for the collection of data, and disclose to me what data is collected and why so that I can make informed decisions about my data. 
\paragraph{Accessabilty Analysis}
As a system user with accessability requirements I need to the software to be accessible to me by complying with modern accessability standards so that I can use it to best advantage.
\paragraph{Intelectual Property and Licensing Implications}
As a product owner I need to know what the licensing and intellectual property constraints of the software are so that I can use it in full legal compliance and honor the rights of the intellectual property owners. 
\subsubsection{Project License}
\paragraph{Determine the Project License}
As a product owner I need to know what license the product falls under so I that its usage complies with the license. 
\subsubsection{Software and Data Inventory}
\paragraph{Software Inventory}
As a maintainer I need to know what software is a direct dependency of the system as well as this software's license, provenance, cost model and the version in use, so that I can build, test, extend and maintain the system.
\paragraph{Data Inventory}
As a maintainer I need to know what data the software directly depends on as well as this data's license, provenance, cost model and the version used, so I can build, test, extend and maintain the system.
\subsubsection{Deployment Guide}
\paragraph{Java Application Deployment Instructions}
As a client I need instructions on how to deploy and run the Java application so I can perform actions using it.
\paragraph{Python Application Deployment Instructions}
As a client I need instructions on how to deploy and run the Python application so I can perform actions using it.
\subsubsection{Test Evidence}
\paragraph{Automated Test Evidence}
As a product owner I need evidence of the system passing automated tests so that I know the software runs correctly in the tested areas. 
\paragraph{Automated Test Running Instructions}
As a maintainer I need instructions on how to run the automated test suite so that I can test any changes or extensions to the software to ensure their correctness.
\paragraph{End to End Test Evidence}
As a product owner I need evidence of the system passing end to end tests so that I know the software runs correctly in the tested areas.
\subsubsection{Presentation}
\paragraph{The Problem}
As a product owner I need to see that the group are aware of the problem the system will solve so that we both reach a point of understanding and agreement in relation to the problem.
\paragraph{Approach}
As a product owner I need to see what approach the group took to solving the problem and how they designed their solution so that I can make an informed decision about it's adoption, utility, and effectiveness.
\paragraph{Implementation}
As a product owner I need to see what path was taken to implement the product and how it was implemented so that I can understand the implementation and see why they made different decisions in relation to the implementation.
\paragraph{Evaluation}
As a product owner I need to see an evaluation of the prototype so that I am informed of its advantages and limitations and thus can know its utility and where best to use it. 
\paragraph{Demonstration}
As a product owner I need to see a demonstration of the prototype so that I can see that it works, how to use it, and what it offers as well as to evidence what has been done in the project.
\paragraph{Limitations and Next Steps}
As a product owner I need to see where the project is going to next so that I can see it will be improved in areas of limitation and that the group is on schedule to deliver the complete system.
