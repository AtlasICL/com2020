\section{Project Backlog}
The project was split into three main sections representing the three main areas of work: the documentation, the java application, and the python application. Each of those areas is then further divided into epics and user stories. The epics and stories in this section include both those relevant to sprint 1 and what is planned for sprint 2. Due to the nature of scrum, the epics for sprint 2 may have adapted by the end of that sprint, and so may differ from the epics and stories in this prototype report.

\paragraph{Executive Summary}
As a product owner I need an executive summary to give me an insight into what is to come in the report and provide the most important details to me.
