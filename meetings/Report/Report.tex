\section{Project Backlog}
The project was split into three main sections representing the three main areas of work: the documentation, the java application, and the python application. Each of those areas is then further divided into epics and user stories. The epics and stories in this section include both those relevant to sprint 1 and what is planned for sprint 2. Due to the nature of scrum, the epics for sprint 2 may have adapted by the end of that sprint, and so may differ from the epics and stories in this prototype report. 
\subsection{Documentation}
\subsubsection{Prototype Report}
\paragraph{Executive Summary}
As a product owner I need an executive summary to give me an insight into what is to come in the report and provide the most important details to me.
\paragraph{Project Backlog}
As a scrum master I need a project backlog so I can determine what work is to be done in each sprint.
\paragraph{Sprint One Prioritised Requirements}
As a product owner I need to know what requirements are being prioritised in sprint one to know that they align with my priorities.
\paragraph{Architecture Schema}
As a developer I need to know what the project schema is so I can produce code that integrates with it correctly.
\paragraph{Data Flow Schema}
As a developer I need to know what the flow of data is so I can work with the data in a manner that integrates well with the rest of the system.
\paragraph{Telemetry Schema}
As a developer I need to know the telemetry schema so I can interact with telemetry events correctly in a way which integrates well with the rest of the system.
\paragraph{Initial Evaluation}
As a product owner I need an initial evaluation of the prototype so I can see the developers are aware of their product and know what areas to work on in the future to improve it. 
\paragraph{Sprint Two Prioritised Requirements}
As a product owner I need to see what requirements are being prioritised and planned for in sprint two so I can know they align with my priorities. 
\subsubsection{Meeting Minutes}
\paragraph{Meeting Attendance}
As a scrum master I need to know who is attending meetings so I can follow up people not there to ensure they are kept up to date.
\paragraph{Work Completed}
As a scrum master I need to know what work has been completed in each weekly scrum so I can determine what work needs to be prioritised for the next scrum, and plan for the next sprint. 
\paragraph{Topics Discussed}
As a scrum master I need to know what topics were discussed in the weekly scrum so I can keep developers who could not make it to the meeting updated.
\subsubsection{Risk Register}
\paragraph{List of Risks}
As a stakeholder I need to know what risks there are in the software so I can make informed decisions about the adoption and use of the software. 
\paragraph{Risk Mitigations}
As a stakeholder I need each risk to have a mitigation plan and owner so that risks are actively managed and their impact reduced.
\subsubsection{Ethical and Legal Considerations}
\paragraph{Privacy and Data Protection Analysis}
As a product owner I need the software to handle data in full legal compliance and respect the privacy of users to foster user trust, maintain regulatory compliance and minimise privacy risk. 
\paragraph{Consent and Disclosure Analysis}
As a system user I need the software to obtain my consent for the collection of data, and disclose to me what data is collected and why so that I can make informed decisions about my data. 
\paragraph{Accessabilty Analysis}
As a system user with accessability requirements I need to the software to be accessible to me by complying with modern accessability standards so that I can use it to best advantage.
\paragraph{Intelectual Property and Licensing Implications}
As a product owner I need to know what the licensing and intellectual property constraints of the software are so that I can use it in full legal compliance and honor the rights of the intellectual property owners.
