    \item All produced code has any relevant unit and integration tests written.
    \item All produced code passes all tests.
    \item All produced code is documented in the code file with either in Javadoc or Pydoc.
    \item All produced code is documented in the architecture schema within the report.
    \item The work is peer reviewed by someone who did not contribute to it.
    \item All acceptance criteria for stories relevant to the work are met.
