\subsection{Problem Framing}
Game balancing is an essential consideration for game designers, to maximise the experience of all players.
However, they are often posed with the issue of reliance on solely their own intuition and small-scale playtests to achieve this.
These methods can introduce unconscious biases, and may not reflect the views of the game's wider audience - for example, users of varying playstyles.
Subjective assessment makes it difficult for designers to identify problem areas where user engagement depreciates, such as problem spikes.

This project integrates an indie game with a telemetry application, generating intuitive live analytics for several actions as the game is run.
The objective is to aid the designer's understanding of a player's experience, and the balance changes that could be applied to maximise the overall user experience.
