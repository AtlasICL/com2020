The monitoring and maintenance of a game is essential for ensuring that players have an enjoyable experience, and that their engagement remains intact.
However, game designers are often left to rely on their own intuition and small playtests to achieve this.
Relying on subjective assessment makes it difficult for them to identify problem areas of a game where a player's engagement depreciates - such as difficulty spikes or features that provoke inequity between play styles.

This project integrates an indie game with a telemetry application, generating intuitive telemetry events for several actions which are processed and presented in several ways.
The objective is to aid the game designer's understanding of a player's experience, and how they could maintain the game to maximise the overall player experience.
